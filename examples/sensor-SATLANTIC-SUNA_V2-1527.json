The Ntrans indices span the interval [PIXEL_START, PIXEL_END] subset of the original array (1 to 256). Thus Ntrans(i) refers to pixel N = (PIXEL_START+i-1). PIXEL_START and PIXEL_END are defined from calibration data so that the [PIXEL_START, PIXEL_END] interval is the smallest interval of pixels that correspond to the [217 nm, 250 nm] interval of wavelengths. Only a subset of the [PIXEL_START, PIXEL_END] interval is processed to compute nitrate concentration. This subset is defined as the [PIXEL_FIT_START, PIXEL_FIT_END] interval which is the smallest interval of pixels that correspond to the [217 nm, 240 nm] interval of wavelengths (thus PIXEL_FIT_START = PIXEL_START). In the following equations the data are computed for each pixel R = PIXEL_FIT_START to PIXEL_FIT_END; ABSORBANCE_SW(R) = -log10[(UV_INTENSITY_NITRATE(R)-UV_INTENSITY_DARK_NITRATE)/UV_INTENSITY_REF_NITRATE(R)]; F(R,T) = (A+B*T)*exp[(C+D*T)*(OPTICAL_WAVELENGTH_UV(R)-OPTICAL_WAVELENGTH_OFFSET)]; E_SWA_INSITU(R) = E_SWA_NITRATE(R)*F(R,TEMP)/F(R,TEMP_CAL_NITRATE); ABSORBANCE_COR_NITRATE(R) = ABSORBANCE_SW(R)-(E_SWA_INSITU(R)*PSAL)*[1-(0.026*PRES/1000)]; Perform a multilinear regression to get MOLAR_NITRATE with estimated ABSORBANCE_COR_NITRATE(R) with ABSORBANCE_COR_NITRATE(R) = BASELINE_INTERCEPT+BASELINE_SLOPE*OPTICAL_WAVELENGTH_UV(R)+MOLAR_NITRATE*E_NITRATE(R); NITRATE = MOLAR_NITRATE/rho, where rho is the potential density [kg/L] calculated from CTD data",
